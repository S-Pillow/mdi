# MDI Release Readiness and Operator Handoff

**Audience:** analysts, operators, and maintainers  
**Status:** MDI is good enough for internal analyst use with the limitations below.  
**Production URL:** `https://forgeforward.app/tools/mdi/`

## 1. Release Status

MDI is release-ready for internal use as a production-capable prototype. No current
release blocker is known.

The UI/workflow is locked as good enough. Additional UI-only work should be
blocked unless it addresses one of:

- functional defect
- unreadable or unclickable control
- broken workflow
- accessibility failure
- major layout regression
- misleading quota/action behavior
- production-blocking usability issue

Taste-only changes belong in backlog.

## 2. Production Version Alignment

| Component | Production state | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | MDI-38: `b83c8799095356f0988fa0ab02f0553fb9ad04b2` | Static bundle deploy |
| Backend | MDI-34: `719e40521de566331628f0683f2755e8bf31f691` | `/api/mdi/version` build marker |

The frontend/backend split is expected. MDI-35, MDI-36, and MDI-38 were
frontend-only changes, so backend `build_info.commit` intentionally remains at
MDI-34 until a backend deploy occurs.

## 3. Stabilization Sequence

| Ticket | Outcome |
|---|---|
| MDI-30A | CSV/XLSX upload workflow accepted |
| MDI-30B | Settings cleanup accepted |
| MDI-30C | Row More Actions accepted |
| MDI-31 | Build review / reconciliation completed |
| MDI-32 | Documentation reconciliation merged |
| MDI-33 | Row menu click-target fix accepted |
| MDI-34 | Open in VirusTotal support accepted |
| MDI-35 | Post-results layout cleanup and UTC quota labels accepted |
| MDI-36 | Dashboard overlay / narrow viewport cleanup accepted |
| MDI-37 | Good-enough checkpoint completed |
| MDI-38 | Results mode, Start New Scan, centered filters, and calculated Age column accepted |

## 5. Final Acceptance Matrix

### Backend Test History

Do not read this section as tests run during MDI-39. It summarizes prior
stabilization evidence.

| Area | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Full backend suite | Prior full suite reported `812 passed` |
| Upload workflow | MDI-30A upload parser/workflow tests |
| Open in VT | MDI-34 `vt_gui_url` tests |
| Quota safety | quota lock / usage tests |
| Persistence | job persistence and recovery tests |
| Exports | export tests |
| Dashboard | dashboard tests |
| Error handling | error taxonomy tests |

### Frontend Build History

`npm run build` passed during the relevant frontend tickets including MDI-30B,
MDI-30C, MDI-33, MDI-35, MDI-36, and MDI-38.

### Production Smoke History

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| MDI-30A upload acceptance | Accepted |
| MDI-30C row actions | Accepted |
| MDI-30B Settings labels | Accepted |
| MDI-33 row menu click target | Accepted |
| MDI-34 Open in VT | Accepted |
| MDI-35 results-first layout and UTC quota labels | Accepted |
| MDI-36 dashboard overlay | Accepted |
| MDI-38 results mode / Start New Scan / Age column | Accepted |

Recent frontend/read-only smokes consumed no quota and did not modify runtime
metadata. Production upload acceptance consumed expected quota only when an
operator explicitly ran the upload job.

## 6. Operator Workflow

1. Open `/tools/mdi/`.
2. Paste domains/URLs or upload a CSV/XLSX.
3. If uploading, click **Validate Upload** and review accepted/rejected/held items.
4. Click **Estimate Quota & Runtime**.
5. Review quota warnings and settings.
6. Click **Run MDI Check** only when ready.
7. Review triage cards.
8. Filter results.
9. Open the detail drawer for evidence.
10. Use Row More Actions when needed:
    - **Export evidence (JSON)**
    - **Open in VirusTotal**
    - **Refresh report**
    - **Request new scan**
11. Use bulk actions if needed.
12. Export results if needed.
13. Use **Start New Scan** to clear the displayed frontend results and return to
    input/setup mode.

Do not use Refresh Report, Request New Scan, or auto-rescan casually; they can
consume shared VT quota.

## 7. Quota-Safe Operating Rules

| Action | VT quota impact |
|---|---|
| Paste validation | None |
| Upload preview / validation | None |
| Estimate Quota & Runtime | None |
| Run MDI Check | Consumes quota for eligible items |
| Held-domain VT/live skip | No VT/live checks for held domains |
| Refresh Report | Consumes quota when confirmed |
| Request New Scan | Consumes quota when confirmed; often more than Refresh |
| Auto-rescan | OFF by default; quota-impacting when enabled |
| Open in VirusTotal | Opens public VT GUI; no VT API quota |
| Export actions | No VT quota |
| Dashboard | No VT quota |
| Start New Scan | No VT quota; clears displayed frontend results only |

Daily quota is UTC-based. A recovered job may show VT lookups from a previous UTC
day while the current **Used today (UTC)** counter remains separate.

## 8. Runtime and Data Handling

Runtime files are excluded from Git. Operators may inspect metadata such as
mtime, size, and line count, but must not print or paste runtime file contents.

Known runtime files:

- `vt_usage.json`
- `vt_usage_history.jsonl`
- `vt_daily_history.json`
- `mdi_latest_job.json`
- `vt_usage.lock`

Rules:

- Do not manually edit runtime files.
- Do not print runtime file contents.
- Latest job recovery uses the persisted MDI snapshot.
- Dashboard history is metadata-focused.
- Frontend-only deploys should not touch runtime files.
- Backend deploys must follow the production runbook and preserve runtime files.

See [Runtime Data](runtime-data.md) for the detailed inventory and side-effect
matrix.

## 9. Deployment and Rollback Handoff

Use the existing deployment docs:

- [Deployment Notes](deployment/deployment-notes.md)
- [Production Runbook](runbooks/mdi-production-runbook.md)

Minimum frontend-only deploy checklist:

1. Confirm source branch, commit, and clean working tree.
2. Record current frontend bundle hashes from `/tools/mdi/`.
3. Record backend `/api/mdi/version` and `/api/mdi/health`.
4. Record quota from `/api/mdi/usage`.
5. Record runtime metadata only (mtime/size/line count as applicable).
6. Build frontend with `npm run build`.
7. Back up `/var/www/html/tools/mdi/`.
8. `rsync -a --delete dist/ /var/www/html/tools/mdi/`.
9. Confirm new bundle hashes are served.
10. Run read-only production smoke unless quota-consuming acceptance is explicitly approved.
11. Re-check quota and runtime metadata.

Frontend-only deploys do not require backend restart or nginx reload when only
static files change. Roll back by rsyncing a prior `/var/www/html/tools/mdi.bak-*`
directory back to `/var/www/html/tools/mdi/`.

Old frontend backups accumulate. Prune only after an agreed stabilization window.

## 10. Known Limitations

| Limitation | Classification |
|---|---|
| Frontend/backend version split after frontend-only deploys | Acceptable |
| No persistent searchable historical domain database | Acceptable |
| Dashboard history is metadata-focused | Acceptable |
| Older dashboard records may lack full triage aggregates | Acceptable |
| Open in VirusTotal depends on saved `vt_report_url` | Acceptable |
| Refresh/Scan consume quota when confirmed | Acceptable |
| Auto-rescan is off by default but quota-impacting when enabled | Acceptable |
| Narrow/mobile use is not primary; desktop 1280+ smoke tested | Acceptable |
| RDAP/WHOIS/live-check failures may occur due to upstream variability | Acceptable |
| In-flight jobs across backend restart are limited; latest completed/error snapshot recovery is supported | Acceptable |
| Old frontend backups accumulate until operator cleanup | Housekeeping |
| Failed/error job edge cases were not fully production-smoked during final UI smoke | Future test |
| Current completed non-recovered job path was not live-smoked during MDI-38 because no live job was submitted | Future test |

## 11. Future Backlog / Non-Blocking Items

- Add quota-cost hint parity for Request New Scan tooltip.
- Add backup-pruning routine or runbook note.
- Surface dashboard quota trends if still desired.
- Add searchable historical job/domain history if approved.
- Add additional export scopes if needed.
- Add more complete automated frontend tests if the project expands.
- Smoke failed/error job UI when a safe fixture/state is available.

## 12. Change Control

MDI UI/workflow is locked as good enough for internal use. Future UI-only changes
should not proceed unless they address a real defect, an accessibility issue, a
misleading quota/action behavior, a broken workflow, or an approved product
decision.

For any future work, keep merge approval and deployment approval separate.
